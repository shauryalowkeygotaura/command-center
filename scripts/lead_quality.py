#!/usr/bin/env python3
"""
lead_quality.py - decide whether a scraped listing is a business that can
actually buy, and write the one-line description the CALL panel shows.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
Measured on the 13 daily files in public/calls/ (516 entries, 2026-08-15 to
2026-09-03): 124 of them, 24%, were government facilities. CGHS dispensaries,
ESI dispensaries, MCD/NDMC dispensaries, Aam Aadmi polyclinics, Chandigarh
civil and ayurvedic dispensaries. Two whole days (08-17, 08-27) were almost
nothing else.

They arrive because build_call_list.py's Overpass fallback queries
`amenity=clinic` and `healthcare=clinic` alongside the dentist tags, and in
Indian OSM data that branch is largely public health infrastructure. It is
over-represented on top of that: government facilities were mapped from civic
data WITH phone numbers, while private clinics often carry no phone tag, and
the only filter in _collect() was "has a phone".

None of them can buy. There is no owner, no P&L, no marketing budget, and any
spend goes through a tender. A call to one is a call not made to a clinic that
could say yes.

WHAT IT DOES NOT DO
-------------------
Chains (Clove Dental, Sabka Dentist, Apollo) are labelled, not dropped. They
are unlikely to buy from a cold call either, because procurement is central,
but that is a judgement about the offer rather than a fact about the entity,
so the row stays and simply says what it is.

# --- Ranking ---------------------------------------------------------------
# Fifty calls a day, worked top to bottom, and the day usually runs out before
# the list does. So the order is the product.
#
# WHAT IS DEFENSIBLE AND WHAT IS A GUESS - read this before trusting a number.
#
# The TIER is definitional, not predictive. It asks the only two questions that
# have to be true before a call can possibly work:
#     can this call reach someone with the authority to say yes?
#     does the pitch land on this kind of business?
# A is both, B is one, C is neither. That is the same test that removed the
# government listings: a civil dispensary fails both, so it is not a lead.
#
# The SCORE only breaks ties inside a tier, and its weights are STATED PRIORS,
# not measured ones. Nothing here has been checked against call outcomes,
# because no call outcome is recorded anywhere yet - the panel stores a `called`
# boolean and nothing else. Treat the score as an argument, which is why every
# row carries the reasons that produced it. What would make it real: record per
# call whether it reached a decision-maker and whether it went anywhere, then
# compare tiers. Until then, ordering is a hypothesis.
#
# The two priors that ARE grounded in something, from the only two clinics that
# have actually bought (assistant/clinics/*_CLIENT.md in dental-receptionist):
#   - Both had a website, one with an online booking page. So a website is a
#     POSITIVE adoption signal here. The old acquisition README says to
#     prioritise clinics with no website; that belonged to the earlier free
#     website-chatbot offer, and is stale for a phone product.
#   - Both are Jaipur, and one carries 1,150+ Google reviews. A busy practice
#     misses more calls, which is the entire pitch.
# n=2 cannot set a weight. It can only stop the ranking from putting known
# customers at the bottom, which is the check test_ranking_matches_real_clients
# makes.
